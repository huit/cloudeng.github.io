HUIT Cloud Engineering Blog
===========================

This repo contains the "Cloud Hacks" blog of the Cloud Engineering Team within HUIT (Harvard Univerisity IT). It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and hosted via S3 (at this time) at the URL:

- http://cloudhacks.huit.harvard.edu/

All the actual content is in the `gh-pages` branch, to be consistent with GitHub's [automatic page generation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator).

Info on building and updating the blog is, self-referentially, blogged about here:

The more gory details about using Jekyll and hosting on S3 described here:
